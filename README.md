## General info
The above project was undertaken so as to recreate and reconstruct Ruby iterators & enumerable methods without the use of any in-built iterators, and that would work perfectly on arrays and Hashes just like the Ruby enumerators. I created a Module that houses all my iterator methods. It is created and built by <a href="https://github.com/adaorachi">MaryAnn Chukwuka</a>.

## Setup
It is pretty simple to setup. All you have to do is to clone the project into your local repository.

## Technologies
* Ruby (Language)
* VSCode (Text Editor)

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* I do not have any future or TODO development for now. I will definitely give out a notice should we decide to.

## Status
The project is currently finished.
